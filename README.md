# SkillCraftTechnology-WebDev-Task4
🚀 Just built a responsive and interactive To-Do List Web App with a Day/Night Mode Switcher!

🌞 Day mode features a bright sunny background, while 🌌 Night mode brings a relaxing starry sky
 — all made possible using CSS variables and JavaScript toggle functionality.

📝 Key Features:
 ✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks easily
 ⏰ Set deadlines with date & time picker
 🎨 Smooth theme switcher with animated transitions
 💡 Clean UI, fully responsive, and beginner-friendly
💻 Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project taught me a lot about UI/UX design, DOM manipulation, and interactive frontend development.
